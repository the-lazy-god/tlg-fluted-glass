# TLG Fluted Glass
Create a fluted glass texture effect on any image on you web page. Powered by the Three.js library. This script creates a Three.js canvas using an image for base texture, and simulates a fluted glass effect while providing options to customize the number of segments and motion.

## âœ… Required Setup

### 1: Define canvas container(s)

Add the attribute below to any div element you want to contain a fluted glass effect.

**Note:** This element is automatically set to `position:relative;`. Give it the size you want the canvas to be using height and width or width and aspect ratio.

**Attribute:**

-   Name: `tlg-fluted-glass-canvas`

### 2: Define image source element(s)

Within each canvas container, include one or more image elements with the attribute `tlg-fluted-glass-image`. One of these images will be used as the base texture in the fluted glass effect. If more than one image element is used, a random will be chosen on page load.

**Note:** Hide the source images with `display:none;`.

**Attribute:**

-   Name: `tlg-fluted-glass-image`

## ðŸ”„ Optional Customization

### Set the number of segments

Control the number of segments in the fluted glass by adding the `tlg-fluted-glass-segments` attribute to the container with attribute `tlg-fluted-glass-canvas`. 

Default is 50 segments.

**Attribute (Optional):**

-   Name: `tlg-fluted-glass-segments`
-   Value: `{number}` (Default = 50)

### Set texture rotation

Control the rotation of the fluted glass segments by adding the `tlg-fluted-glass-rotation` attribute to the container with attribute `tlg-fluted-glass-canvas`. 

Enter the number of degrees you want to rotate the segments counter clockwise. Default is 0. Using 180 will effectively swap the direction of the motion.

**Attribute (Optional):**

-   Name: `tlg-fluted-glass-rotation`
-   Value: `{number}` (Degrees counter clockwise rotation. Default = 0)
